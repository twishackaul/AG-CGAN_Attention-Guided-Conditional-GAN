## AG-CGAN: Attention Guided Conditional GAN

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a prominent method for data augmentation over the years. GANs were introduced to mitigate the problems faced by traditional data augmentation methods like rotating, flipping, scaling, etc. GANs help generate high-quality and non-repetitive data to enhance performance in deep learning models. However, despite their advancements in comparison to the old data augmentation methods, traditional GANs face the issue of generating data that might fail to capture the critical features required to enhance a model’s robustness. 
### To overcome this issue, our paper presents a novel approach of introducing an attention mechanism within the GAN architecture, which guides the GAN to concentrate on the underlying patterns and generate images based on the critical & intricate spatial features/details required for enhancing a model’s performance. In addition to this, we also applied conditioning to the architecture such that the model generates contextually relevant images with respect to the classes/labels of our dataset i.e. Pneumonia & Normal (X-Ray frames). After training on various batch sizes and epochs, our best model achieved an accuracy of 79.49%.
